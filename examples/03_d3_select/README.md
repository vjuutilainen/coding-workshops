# Selecting and manipulating elements with D3.js

This example demonstrates how to select and manipulate an element on the page using `select` method provided by D3.js library. The D3.js library (file *d3.min.js*) is located in the local folder and added with `<script type="text/javascript" src="d3.min.js"></script>`.

The select method returns a special d3 selection, which is an array containing the first matched element.
