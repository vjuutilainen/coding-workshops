# Coding workshops

This is a work in progress. Emphasis on interactive data visualization and journalism.

## Prerequisites

- [Codecademy: HTML & CSS](https://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/web) (at least *HTML Basics*)
- [Codecademy: JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/javascript) (at least *Getting Started with Programming*)
- See what happens when you change some of the colors or numbers and click *Run* on this [online code editor with SVG graphics](http://jsfiddle.net/g8opryxy/)
- Feel free to change color or number values in HTML or JavaScript code in this [example using D3.js library](http://jsfiddle.net/toqu5f52/)

## Opening and editing examples on your own computer

Download a copy of this repository on your computer as a [zip file](https://github.com/vjuutilainen/coding-workshops/archive/master.zip), extract the archive and navigate through *coding-workshops-master/examples/01_svg/* to find an *index.html* file to open SVG graphics in your browser. Then open the same file in a text editor (see Tools section below), change some color or number values, and refresh your browser to see the results.

Inside the main folder *coding-workshops-master* you will also find this file you are reading now, *README.md*, which is written and formatted using [Markdown language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).
